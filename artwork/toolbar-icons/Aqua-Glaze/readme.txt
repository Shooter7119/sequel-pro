The icons in this directory were created by Saki (http://www.iconsdesigns.com/), and have been used with permission.

At the time of release, no license had been provided. But all of the other icon sets I could find by Saki are either GPL or LGPL, and his website clearly states these icons can be used in open source projects:

Excerpt from http://www.iconsdesigns.com/: These free icons are provided to be used as a replacement icon theme for your operating system only. You can also use them on your open source projects. For non open source projects such as commercial ones, products website, personal website, blog, commercial or personal applications, documentation, etc. asking a permission to use them is mandatory and you will have to give credit for them. Thank you!
