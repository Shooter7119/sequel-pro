#labels Featured

The best person to contact for questions/comments about Sequel Pro is Abhi Beckert. You can reach him via http://abhibeckert.com/contact (I do not wish to publish my email address due to spammers).

If you have feature requests or bug reports you can also contact Abhi, but we prefer such things are added as tickets to the [http://code.google.com/p/sequel-pro/issues/list Issues Tracker].
